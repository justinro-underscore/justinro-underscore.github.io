# To Create a Level

1. Create your image in GIMP (any program works but I'm using GIMP)
   a. Make sure your image has an alpha channel
2. Add a new layer - this will be your solution
3. Draw your solution on top using **white** pixels
   a. Do not use any other colors on your solution layer
4. Go into `Edit Layer Attributes` for your solution layer
5. For `Mode` select `Erase`
6. (Optional) Change the opacity of your solution layer so you can see the layer below (but make sure it's above 0!)
7. Export your file as `.png` into the raw directory
8. Run the converter on your image and you are done!
