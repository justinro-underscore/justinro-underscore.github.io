              is a company that specializes in the development and manufacturing
              of two-way radios for public safety uses. The products they develop
              include portable, handheld two-way radios, mobile base stations,
              and computer applications. Their headquarters are in Melbourne, Florida,
              but their engineering office is located in Lawrence, Kansas - this
              is where I've worked since January of 2018. During my time here, I've
              worked on a variety of things, and have learned <i>a lot</i>.<br>
              <br>
              A majority of my time at BK Technologies was spent working on their
              computer applications. Working on these applications gave me extensive
              practice in java (and a little bit of C#). One thing I enjoyed about
              my internship here is that there was largely no hand-holding - if you
              needed it, the full-timers loved to help, but by and large you were
              expected to learn most things on your own. This gave me a "trial by fire"
              way of learning the codebase, which I really appreciated. This gave
              me great experience in learning how a large codebase functions from
              the ground up - a skill that will no doubt be very useful in my future
              ventures.<br>
              <br>
              At BK, I was not <i>only</i> working on the computer applications,
              I was also working on our autotesting software and radio development.
              The autotesting software was created using Pytest, which was a fun
              time for me, a guy that had not known Python before this internship.
              Thanks to this, I now have a deeper understanding of Python and its
              uses. The autotesting software also used a lot of advanced Python,
              which was a great learning experience.<br>
              <br>

                <img style="float:right;" src="Images/Radio.jpg">
              </a>
              The final thing I contributed to at BK was the radio software. BK Technologies
              is ultimately a radio company, and while the computer applications and
              autotesting system were important, their radios are the reason the
              company exists. I mostly worked on user interface and fixed bugs on the
              software side, but I was also able to help work on the new technology
              that is coming out. Much like the computer applications and autotest
              system, the radio's infrastructure is quite large. Working on these three
              different codebases gave a me fantastic experience in not only different
              coding styles, but also different design patterns.<br>
              <br>
              Overall, my time at BK Technologies has been very informative and
              an invaluable learning experience. I not only obtained an insane amount
              of knowledge when it comes to programming, but I also learned how the scrum
              process model works in industry. The experience was a great one, and I
              sincerely thank everyone who made it happen.

            <h1 class="index-subtitle"><b>Kansas Algebra Program</b> - Teaching Assistant / Tutor</h1>
            <p>
              <span class="dates"><i>August 2017 - December 2017</i></span>
              <a href="https://sota.ku.edu/sites/sota.ku.edu/files/styles/slideshow-1180/public/images/slideshow/Strong2.jpg?itok=5t8Od8M4" target="_blank">
                <img style="float:right;" src="Images/StrongHall.jpg"><br>
              </a>
              The <a href="https://mathematics.ku.edu/kap" target="_blank">Kansas Algebra
              Program</a> (or KAP) is a university-run organization that facilitates
              MATH 002 (Intermediate Algebra) and MATH 101 (College Algebra) classes
              for students. Not only do they offer the courses, they also have designated
              testing and a help room where students can come and ask tutors questions
              about the material. I worked at KAP for one whole semester, and that was
              enough time to refine my teaching skills and practice my communication
              skills.<br>
              <br>
              At KAP, my official job title was <i>Teaching Assistant</i>, but that
              doesn't quite explain what I did during my time there. While at KAP,
              I was in charge of my very own MATH 101 (College Algebra) class with
              about twenty-five students. I was tasked with preparing lectures,
              grading homework, and being there for my students if they ever needed
              help with any aspect of the class. The workload was immense but highly
              rewarding - I taught the class three times a week for an hour,
              and grading homework took roughly another four to six hours on top of that.
              This was one of the reasons why I left KAP - the workload was just
              a bit too much for a student who was in charge of a club, in a jazz band,
              and was taking seventeen credit hours. That doesn't mean I didn't
              enjoy it, though. Teaching gave me a great opportunity to practice
              my communication skills, and preparing lessons allowed me to exercise
              creativity to help students understand complicated topics.<br>
              <br>
              Being a Teaching Assistant did not only include teaching a class,
              but it also meant I was responsible for tutoring in the Help Room as
              well. KAP's Help Room is a place where students can go to ask questions
              and get help on the homework and material for the class. As a tutor,
              I was responsible for knowing the material and being able to explain
              said material in a logical way to students who were confused. The process
              gave me valuable practice in explaining concepts to people who didn't
              understand them, something that is very useful in the field of programming.<br>
              <br>
              I ended up leaving KAP for two reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>The workload was getting to be too much to handle.</li>
                <li>I got an offer to work at BK Technologies.</li>
              </ol>
              While my time at KAP was short, it was filled with fantastic people
              and a billion learning experiences. KAP helped me strengthen my skills
              as a speaker, as well as helped me expand my knowledge of linear algebra,
              a concept that shows up very frequently in the glorious world of Computer
              Science.

              is a high-end mexican restuarant in the Dallas area, focusing on Santa
              Fe, Tex-Mex, and classical Mexico City cuisines. I started working
              at the Plano location right before they opened in 2016, and worked
              there through my senior year of high school to my sophomore year of
              college. I worked as a host, meaning I was in charge of choosing where
              to seat guests, as well as performing various duties around the restuarant.<br>
              <br>
              Being a host taught me a lot about communication and patience.
              The restuarant was quite popular, especially during the
              summer, and wait times would frequently reach up to two hours for a
              table. Due to my position, I was responsible for telling guests how
              long they should wait, and many times people were not happy about the
              time I gave them. I would patiently listen to guests complaints about the wait
              time and inform them I couldn't do anything about it. This patience was a skill
              that would come in handy at my next job working as a college algebra
              teacher and tutor.<br>
              <br>
              Working at M&iacute; D&iacute;a was also a leadership opportunity.
              Because I was a part of the original crew that helped open the restuarant,
              I was given the role of teacher for many new hosts. This responsibility
              was a great honor, and I did my best to make my managers proud.<br>
              <br>
              When I moved to Kansas to pursue my college career, I did not entirely
              quit M&iacute; D&iacute;a. Instead, I would work whenever I was back
              home, whether it be for a short time (weekends) or a long time (school
              breaks). From year and a half of working as a host, I learned plenty
              of soft skills that would help me no matter where I went in life.
              I learned how to effectively communicate with people who know nothing
              about the industry, I learned how to teach others all aspects of a
              complicated job, and I also learned how to manage my time well, and
              make sure that things moved smoothly and effectively.
