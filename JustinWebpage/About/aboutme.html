              When I was in 5th grade, I created a dinosaur-themed, Candyland-esque board game
              with my friend.<br><br>
              When I was in 8th grade, I dumped hours of my life into creating a detective game
              satirizing film noir tropes using a program called RPG Maker.<br><br>
              When I was in the 9th grade, I hopped on the zombie craze and created a zombie
              survival board game with a few buddies.<br><br>
              In the 12th grade, I started programming. Everything changed.<br><br>

              When I was around ten years old, my father started a business called
              <a href="https://www.in2innovation.com/" target="_blank">In2Innovation</a>.
              Their mission statement was to simplify the lives of users by doing product design
              with an emphasis on user experience. Growing up, I always imagined myself becoming
              a product designer and helping my dad create products. Going into my senior year,
              my mother, a software engineer, urged me to take a programming class, and I begrudgingly
              complied. My life changed from then on. I fell in love with the act of coding, and
              became infatuated with the places this skill could take me. It was in this year that
              I took a hard look at my life, at the plan I had laid out for myself, at the things
              I was passionate about, and at the "just for fun" projects I had been doing all my
              life. Through this, I discovered a new route for me, one that combined my newfound
              love of programming with the distilled essence of why I wanted to work with my father.
              I no longer wanted to create products that, through user experience, made peoples' lives
              easier. <b>I wanted to create experiences themselves.</b><br><br>

              I wanted to create experiences that made people learn, experiences that made people laugh,
              experiences that made people feel. I began devoting my free time to learning about this
              trade - I took on a film studies minor where I could study how movies like Die Hard
              made me feel like a badass and how every single Pixar movie made me want to bawl my
              eyes out. I began focusing more on video game development, as that was the best way
              for me to deliver these experiences to people in a straightforward way. After a few
              years of working on these skills, I am ready to put them to the test, and continue
              to refine my craft. That is my mission, my goal. I know that if I work hard and smart
              enough, one day I will be able to do this for my job, and that is what I am working towards.

              <a href="https://www.bktechnologies.com/" target="_blank">BK Technologies</a>
              is a company that specializes in the development and manufacturing
              of two-way radios for public safety uses. The products they develop
              include portable, handheld two-way radios, mobile base stations,
              and computer applications. Their headquarters are in Melbourne, Florida,
              but their engineering office is located in Lawrence, Kansas - this
              is where I've worked since January of 2018. During my time here, I've
              worked on a variety of things, and have learned <i>a lot</i>.<br>
              <br>
              A majority of my time at BK Technologies was spent working on their
              computer applications. Working on these applications gave me extensive
              practice in java (and a little bit of C#). One thing I enjoyed about
              my internship here is that there was largely no hand-holding - if you
              needed it, the full-timers loved to help, but by and large you were
              expected to learn most things on your own. This gave me a "trial by fire"
              way of learning the codebase, which I really appreciated. This gave
              me great experience in learning how a large codebase functions from
              the ground up - a skill that will no doubt be very useful in my future
              ventures.<br>
              <br>
              At BK, I was not <i>only</i> working on the computer applications,
              I was also working on our autotesting software and radio development.
              The autotesting software was created using Pytest, which was a fun
              time for me, a guy that had not known Python before this internship.
              Thanks to this, I now have a deeper understanding of Python and its
              uses. The autotesting software also used a lot of advanced Python,
              which was a great learning experience.<br>
              <br>
              <a href="https://www.bktechnologies.com/product-category/portables/" target="_blank">
                <img style="float:right;" src="Images/Radio.jpg">
              </a>
              The final thing I contributed to at BK was the radio software. BK Technologies
              is ultimately a radio company, and while the computer applications and
              autotesting system were important, their radios are the reason the
              company exists. I mostly worked on user interface and fixed bugs on the
              software side, but I was also able to help work on the new technology
              that is coming out. Much like the computer applications and autotest
              system, the radio's infrastructure is quite large. Working on these three
              different codebases gave a me fantastic experience in not only different
              coding styles, but also different design patterns.<br>
              <br>
              Overall, my time at BK Technologies has been very informative and
              an invaluable learning experience. I not only obtained an insane amount
              of knowledge when it comes to programming, but I also learned how the scrum
              process model works in industry. The experience was a great one, and I
              sincerely thank everyone who made it happen.

            <h1 class="index-subtitle"><b>Kansas Algebra Program</b> - Teaching Assistant / Tutor</h1>
            <p>
              <span class="dates"><i>August 2017 - December 2017</i></span>
              <a href="https://sota.ku.edu/sites/sota.ku.edu/files/styles/slideshow-1180/public/images/slideshow/Strong2.jpg?itok=5t8Od8M4" target="_blank">
                <img style="float:right;" src="Images/StrongHall.jpg"><br>
              </a>
              The <a href="https://mathematics.ku.edu/kap" target="_blank">Kansas Algebra
              Program</a> (or KAP) is a university-run organization that facilitates
              MATH 002 (Intermediate Algebra) and MATH 101 (College Algebra) classes
              for students. Not only do they offer the courses, they also have designated
              testing and a help room where students can come and ask tutors questions
              about the material. I worked at KAP for one whole semester, and that was
              enough time to refine my teaching skills and practice my communication
              skills.<br>
              <br>
              At KAP, my official job title was <i>Teaching Assistant</i>, but that
              doesn't quite explain what I did during my time there. While at KAP,
              I was in charge of my very own MATH 101 (College Algebra) class with
              about twenty-five students. I was tasked with preparing lectures,
              grading homework, and being there for my students if they ever needed
              help with any aspect of the class. The workload was immense but highly
              rewarding - I taught the class three times a week for an hour,
              and grading homework took roughly another four to six hours on top of that.
              This was one of the reasons why I left KAP - the workload was just
              a bit too much for a student who was in charge of a club, in a jazz band,
              and was taking seventeen credit hours. That doesn't mean I didn't
              enjoy it, though. Teaching gave me a great opportunity to practice
              my communication skills, and preparing lessons allowed me to exercise
              creativity to help students understand complicated topics.<br>
              <br>
              Being a Teaching Assistant did not only include teaching a class,
              but it also meant I was responsible for tutoring in the Help Room as
              well. KAP's Help Room is a place where students can go to ask questions
              and get help on the homework and material for the class. As a tutor,
              I was responsible for knowing the material and being able to explain
              said material in a logical way to students who were confused. The process
              gave me valuable practice in explaining concepts to people who didn't
              understand them, something that is very useful in the field of programming.<br>
              <br>
              I ended up leaving KAP for two reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>The workload was getting to be too much to handle.</li>
                <li>I got an offer to work at BK Technologies.</li>
              </ol>
              While my time at KAP was short, it was filled with fantastic people
              and a billion learning experiences. KAP helped me strengthen my skills
              as a speaker, as well as helped me expand my knowledge of linear algebra,
              a concept that shows up very frequently in the glorious world of Computer
              Science.

              is a high-end mexican restuarant in the Dallas area, focusing on Santa
              Fe, Tex-Mex, and classical Mexico City cuisines. I started working
              at the Plano location right before they opened in 2016, and worked
              there through my senior year of high school to my sophomore year of
              college. I worked as a host, meaning I was in charge of choosing where
              to seat guests, as well as performing various duties around the restuarant.<br>
              <br>
              Being a host taught me a lot about communication and patience.
              The restuarant was quite popular, especially during the
              summer, and wait times would frequently reach up to two hours for a
              table. Due to my position, I was responsible for telling guests how
              long they should wait, and many times people were not happy about the
              time I gave them. I would patiently listen to guests complaints about the wait
              time and inform them I couldn't do anything about it. This patience was a skill
              that would come in handy at my next job working as a college algebra
              teacher and tutor.<br>
              <br>
              Working at M&iacute; D&iacute;a was also a leadership opportunity.
              Because I was a part of the original crew that helped open the restuarant,
              I was given the role of teacher for many new hosts. This responsibility
              was a great honor, and I did my best to make my managers proud.<br>
              <br>
              When I moved to Kansas to pursue my college career, I did not entirely
              quit M&iacute; D&iacute;a. Instead, I would work whenever I was back
              home, whether it be for a short time (weekends) or a long time (school
              breaks). From year and a half of working as a host, I learned plenty
              of soft skills that would help me no matter where I went in life.
              I learned how to effectively communicate with people who know nothing
              about the industry, I learned how to teach others all aspects of a
              complicated job, and I also learned how to manage my time well, and
              make sure that things moved smoothly and effectively.

              my professor enhoyed it so much, he urged my teammate and I to submit
              it to the KU FMS Tensies Awards (basically the University
              of Kansas Film & Media Studies Department's version of The Oscars).
              We did, and the project ended up being a huge hit! The judges raved
              about the game (one got angry at us because he couldn't stop playing
              for over an hour), and we ended up leaving the awards ceremony with
              the prize for Best New Media Project! It was an insanely cool experience,
              especially because we were able to make a speech when we received our award!

              In February of 2017, I joined the inaugural Jayhacks hackathon (later
              HackKU) to create a game with a small team - that game was
              <a href="https://github.com/justinro-underscore/Terminal---JayHacks-2017" target="_blank">Terminal</a>.
              The game was an asychronous cooperative game where one player uses
              a controller to play a platforming game, while the other player uses
              the keyboard to type commands into a terminal, manipulating the world
              the platformer played in. I go into much more detail about this game
              in the <a href="../Projects/VideoGames/Terminal/terminal.html">Terminal page</a>
              on this website, so I would recommend checking that page for more
              information.<br>
              At the end of the hackathon, Terminal's team ended up taking home
              second place and a pair of Beats headphones! The experience and
              success at this hackathon gave us the skills and confidence to continue
              on with bigger and better projects in the future.<br><br>

              <img style="float:right;margin:15px;" src="Images/ElectionIQ.png"><br>
              In the November of 2016, with very little experience in programming,
              I joined a team of five in the annual Kansas City Federal Reserve
              Code-A-Thon. The team and I had 24 hours to create
              <a href="https://github.com/awarrington0895/ElectionIQ" target="_blank">ElectionIQ</a>,
              a web service that assisted people with the process of navigating
              through the election cycle. The website could help the user register
              to vote, learn who was on their ballot, and find out where they could
              go to cast their vote. The website utilized Google's
              <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/" target="_blank">Civic Information API</a>
              to get the relevant information to the site.<br><br>
              The reason why this isn't on my Projects page on this website is because
              I didn't do much programming here. I did a little bit on the bug-fixing
              side of things but overall I didn't contribute much to the codebase.
              However, that does not mean I didn't do anything. Instead of coding,
              I worked on all the promotional material for ElectionIQ, including
              the video:<br><br>

              At the end of the competition, we were selected to be one of three
              finalists who got to go to Kansas City and present their projects in
              front of a room full of executives from the KC Federal Reserve. This
              was a great opportunity to work on my public speaking and network.
              Thanks to our application, media, and presentations, our team left
              the code-a-thon with first place! The experience gave me a glimpse
              into something I would be doing a lot in the future: working on a team.
              It also gave me a goal: next time I joined a hackathon, I would do
              more programming. And at the Jayhacks Code-A-Thon, that's exactly
              what I did.<br><br>

              </a>
              This is probably my greatest accomplishment.<br><br>
              In October of my freshman year of college, I joined a few of my friends
              in the creation of a cardboard boat to race in the now annual KU Cardboard
              Boat Regatta. Over the course of a month, we designed and built a
              functioning boat out of nothing but cardboard, duct tape, and paint.
              Once the project was complete, I was in charge of sailing the boat,
              named <i>The Reginald</i> after a bug that was found inside. I sailed
              the boat to victory, garnering us the first place prize and a place
              in the <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/oct/16/cardboard-boat-event-more-swim-regatta/" target="_blank">Lawrence Journal-World</a>.<br><br>
              Jokes aside, the competition was a great learning experience. This
              was my first experience of crunch time, which is something I am now
              very familiar with. I also learned that cardboard boats are surprisingly
              expensive, information that has been extremely valuable in my day-to-day
              life.<br><br>

              Due to the recent nature of this leadership role, not much has been

              Machinery club at KU. I act as a sort of moderator, guiding the younger

              For last year's weekend-long hackathon,
              <a href="http://hackku.org/" target="_blank">HackKU</a>, I was not a participant
              but in fact, an organizer. I functioned as HackKU's Events Chair,
              meaning that I was responsible for coordinating events and talks for
              participants to attend. This was a fun adventure, as I not only got
              to exercise my creativity in coming up with possible events to entertain
              competitors, but I also got to communicate with industry professionals
              in helping them set up talks.<br><br>
              This was all done before the hackathon, but during the hackathon I
              had a different role. During the hackathon, I was in charge of making
              sure events went smoothly, that all talks were on-schedule and well-attended.
              I was also the on-campus liaison for the event sponsors, meaning that
              if someone needed something, they came to me. This gave me an opportunity
              to communicate and create friendships with the higher-ups in certain
              companies. In addition to all of this, I was in charge of preparing
              and delivering the opening speech.<br><br>
              Events were not the only thing I was in charge of - I was also in charge
              of <i>capturing the moment</i>. With the assistance of a close friend,
              we created a promotional video for the hackathon that included videos
              of competitors programming; people partaking in the festivies; and
              interviews from the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors. Check out
              the fruits of our labor here:<br><br>

              Last year I functioned as one of two Programming Club Co-Chairs for
              the Association of Computing Machinery club at KU. Programming Club
              was unique, as it was a subset of ACM. Where ACM focused
              more on professional development and industry talks, Programming Club,
              which met after ACM meetings, focused more on the art of programming.
              This featured talks, presentations, workshops, and projects. My job
              as Programming Club Co-Chair was to work with my other Co-Chair in
              the planning and execution of these meetings. These meetings happened
              every other week for an entire year, meaning I planned about 15 or
              16 meetings. This experience not only gave me valuable communication
              and public speaking skills, but it also gave me a much deeper appreciation
              for programming and those who do it. I loved it so much, I decided
              to continue on the board of ACM with the role of Webmaster, info of
              which can be found above.

              I am not just a soulless programmer, destined to spend my life hunched
              over a computer screen, never being able to talk to people in person.
              I also play trombone! I've been in a jazz band since I was in seventh
              grade, and when I came to the University of Kansas I didn't let my
              hectic academic schedule interfere with what I love. I have been and
              am currently the lead trombone in the University of Kansas's prestigious
              Jazz Ensemble II. Not only does this mean that I get to play the high
              notes, but it also means that I am generally the leader of the trombone
              section.<br><br>
              I love jazz band because it is a fantastic creative outlet. Above all,
              improvisation is the best part of jazz band. Improvisation combines
              the creative thought process of <i>What will sound good?</i> with the technical thought
              process of <i>What notes are in the chords?</i> It sounds so clich&eacute;, but improv
              truly gives me an unobstructed outlet to express myself through. I
              believe that it is the purest form of music - the melody being played
              is only slightly influenced by the music behind it; the melody comes
              directly from the performer's heart. And yes, I realize how pretentious
              that may sound, but it's the reason that I continue to play. The
              ability to make music that <i>you</i> come up with is a privilege,
              and I am so lucky to be able to use it.
