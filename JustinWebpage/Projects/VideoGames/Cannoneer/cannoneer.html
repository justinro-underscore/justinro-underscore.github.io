              <br>In the spring of 2018, I took a class on game design. I learned
              a lot game theory and critical analysis of games, but my favorite
              part of the class was the final project, where we had to create our
              own game. Throughout the semester we had to submit Design Proposals
              (which were basically just simplified GDDs), and our final project
              had to be based on one of these proposals. At the end of the semester,
              when it came time to finally develop our project, I knew exactly what
              I wanted to make. It was an homage to the arcade games I grew up playing,
              the ones that defined the way games were played for generations. It
              combined old-school design mechanics with a sea-worthy theme. I decided
              to make <b>Cannoneer</b>.<br><br>

              </div>
              Cannoneer is a horizontal shooter with vertical shooter mechanics, made with Unity.
              In the game, you take control of a pirate ship, and must evade and
              destroy enemy ships that appear above and below you, using your port
              and starboard side cannons. The game takes on a horizontal shooter
              feel, as the game moves from left to right and enemies come from the
              right side of the screen as opposed to the left, but all of the shooting
              occurs on the vertical y-axis. Shooting has a cool-down, simulating
              a cannon reloading, which means players have think twice about the
              shots they take. The game is an homage to classic 1980s arcade games,
              and thus, is best played in a <a href="#Exhibition">cabinet</a>.
              Going with the arcade feel, the goal of the game is to survive infinite
              waves of enemies while trying to get the high score. Each progressive
              level gets more difficult, and different enemies appear the farther
              into the game you get. There are also <a href="secrets.html" class="hidden-link">secrets</a>
              in the game, if you can find them...<br><br>

              While I did a majority of the work on the project, I was not the only
              person working on it. For one, I had my partner on the project, Luke Johnson,
              who worked a majority on the art, documentation, and exhibition of
              the project. I also had help from my roommate Tim Larson, who made
              the soundtracks for the game, as well as my friend Sean Poole, who
              made the original ship and rock sprites for the game. I was in charge
              of the programming as well as the mechanics of the game. I was also
              in charge of wiring up the hardware and getting the cabinet controls
              working.<br><br>

              No great arcade game is complete without an arcade cabinet to hold it.
              There is something special about playing a game with a standard joystick
              and buttons - a feeling that harkens back to a simpler time of video
              games. A time that I was unable to witness, but one that I longed to
              recreate. The cabinet was simple, just a wooden structure that housed
              a monitor and speakers. This monitor was then hooked up to a laptop
              that had an encoder board with the joystick and buttons hooked into it.

              The project was a huge success. Luke did a fantastic job on the painting
              of the cabinet, and Tim's soundtrack combined with Luke and Seans'
              sprites really gave the game that old, arcade feeling that we were
              shooting for (no pun intended). When programming, I tried to stay away
              from tutorials and learn things for myself which, although very difficult
              at times, really immersed me in how Unity works and gave me a good idea
              on how to work on games using Unity in the future.<br>
              Oh, and the game actually won an award! At KU Film & Media Studies's
              Tensies Awards, <i>Cannoneer</i> came away with winning the <b>Best
              New Media</b> award, which was a huge honor!<br><br>
