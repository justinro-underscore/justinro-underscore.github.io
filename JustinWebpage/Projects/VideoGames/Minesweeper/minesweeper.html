              <br>Let's set the scene.<br><br>
              The date is August 2nd, 2018, and I am sitting on a plane on my way to Boston to see my
              friend for the weekend. Attempting to quell my boredom, I begin playing Minesweeper on
              my phone, a common thing to do when I don't have internet. However, today was no ordinary
              day of playing my favorite arcade game. I had long since known about the pitfalls of
              Minesweeper - times when the player has no choice but to guess what cell is a mine and
              what isn't. I hate these moments; in a game solely about logic, it infuriates me when I
              lose due to circumstances outside of my control. With a 4 hour layover in
              Philadelphia, I had a plan. A plan that would make the greatest designers tremble. I would
              attempt to fix a decades-old game, beloved by fans everywhere.<br><br>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)" target="_blank">Minesweeper</a>
              is a fantastic game that most everyone from the 1960s-onwards should know. The game, which
              began as a mainframe game in the 1960s, has a very simple premise: clear out a minefield
              by clicking on cells. Almost every cell has a number, and that number tells the player how
              many mines are adjacent.<br><br>
              <div class="proj-img" style="float:right;">
                <img src="MinesweeperImpossible.png">
                <p>Impossible Move</p>
              </div>
              It's a very simple logic game, but it has one glaring flaw that upsets me. Due to the random
              nature of the game, it is possible (and quite likely) to get into a situation where you have
              no choice but to guess as to which cell is a mine and which one isn't. This can be seen in
              the screenshot to the right. In this shot, it is clear that the top two cells are mines, but it is unclear
              whether the middle cell is a mine or if the bottom cell is a mine. This is by far not the
              only occurrence of this conundrum, but it seems to be the most common.<br><br>
              The goal of this project is deceivingly simple: fix Minesweeper's unfair guessing game. However,
              like most things, it is easier said than done.<br><br>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, this project is a work-in-progress. Right now I have successfully recreated
              Minesweeper in JavaFX, however I have not implemented any checks to see if the game has
              become impossible to complete logically. The screenshots below show the progress that has
              been made:

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
              As stated earlier, this project is not done. The basic functionality of the game is there,
              but my goal was not to simply recreate Minesweeper. The goal was to fix it.<br>
              Unfortunately, I don't really know how to accomplish this task currently, nor do I really
              have the time to do it. Some plans I currently have include creating a bot that will
              solve the puzzle first and figure out what is impossible and what isn't. After that,
              I can think of a way to resolve these situations. During these situations, I was thinking
              another, smaller map would pop up. If the player completed this map, the situation would
              automatically be resolved, and the correct mine would be flagged. There is also the option
              of having a special tool that players can use to flag impossible situations. At the end of
              the game, the game would check these so-called "impossible situations". If they truly
              can't be resolved logically, the player would win. If not, the mines would explode and the
              player would lose. These ideas are admittedly not great, and need some refining. However,
              I hope that once I get the time to finish this project, implementing these ideas won't be
              too difficult.<br><br>
