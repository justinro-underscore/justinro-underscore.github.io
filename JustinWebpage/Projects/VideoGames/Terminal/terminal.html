              <br>Ah, hackathons/codeathons. If you've never experienced a hackathon
              before, here's how it's supposed to work: you get a small team together,
              think of a small, manageable project, and start working on it! You
              sleep for about 6 hours Friday night, maybe 5 hours Saturday night,
              and have good, filling meals at normal times. You spend your time
              socializing with other programmers, talking to potential employers,
              and spend the rest of the time coding while taking frequent breaks to keep
              stress levels down.<br><br>
              At least, that's how it's <i>supposed</i> to work.<br>
              Welcome to <b>Terminal</b>, the ambitious product of our hackathon
              experience.<br><br>

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Terminal</b> is an asychronous, cooperative, puzzle, couch-multiplayer
              game with some unique mechanics. Player One is in charge of the top
              two-thirds of the screen, and for them the game is a platformer. They
              use a controller and are able to jump around the environment, utilizing
              special abilities like wall jumps and a high jump. Player Two is in
              charge of the lower third of the screen, and for them the game is a
              combination of a typing and puzzle game. Player Two uses the keyboard,
              and takes on the role of a hacker, typing in commands to a terminal.
              The "hacker" (Player Two) is able to manipulate the "spy's" (Player
              One's) environment. The two players must work together in order to
              complete levels by using a combination of skillful platforming,
              clever puzzle solving, and fast typing skills.<br><br>

            <h2>The Teamwork</h2>
            <p>
              The team that worked on this project was fairly small. Alex Shadley worked
              on the code along with me, Harry Luo helped a bit on the code and designed
              level two, Jesse Truong worked on the sprites, and my roommate Tim Larson
              wrote the music (he also wrote the music for another one of my projects,
              <a href="../Cannoneer/cannoneer.html">Cannoneer</a>). I functioned as
              a psuedo-design lead, while also working heavily on the codebase.<br><br>

              This game was created in 36 hours at the Jayhacks 2017 hackathon (now
              HackKU), a hackathon that I would end up being on the board for the
              next year! The experience was exciting, as I was awake for 31 of the 36
              hours spent coding. This really taught me how to handle my emotions,
              as when you're awake for more than 24 hours straight working on things
              that should work, you're likely to snap at your teammates. Thankfully,
              everytime my teammates and I would get into an argument, we would take
              a step back, clear our heads, then work together to get to a solution.
              We knew that arguments lead to nothing, and only when we worked together
              could we solve our problems. This proved to be a great skill, as the
              team that stayed in the same room as us was unable to resolve their
              conflicts and came out with a subpar product.<br><br>

            <h2>The Reception</h2>
            <p>
              When the coding was over and we were all smelly and tired, we immediately
              had to go and present our projects. Presentations were done in a large,
              open area, "science fair"-style. We set up our project on a table, and
              the judges and other contestants would walk around to see what we accomplished.
              When they came over, we gave them a brief overview of the game and
              let them play. Watching two people play and enjoy the game that I and
              my teammates had worked so hard on in the past few hours was exhilirating.
              Seeing them laugh and cheer when they figured out one of the more complex
              puzzles in our game gave me so much joy that I didn't stop smiling
              the entire time. This was definitely one of the best moments of my
              life.<br>
              Oh, and we ended up winning as well! Terminal won <b>second place</b>
              at the awards ceremony, and we all ended up receiving free Beats
              headphones! It was a great time, and we were all very proud of the
              work we accomplished.<br><br>
