              <br>When our Software Engineering professor announced our final project,
              he tried to make one thing abundantly clear:<br><br>
              <span style="color: #777777"><i>"When you are working on this project,
                don't try and reinvent the wheel."</i></span><br><br>
              Welcome to EECSurvival and The DFQE - <i>The wheel, reinvented.</i><br><br>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was, in essence, to learn how the wheel works
              by reinventing it. The wheel, in this case, is a game engine. When
              the project was announced, we knew we wanted to create a game, but
              we didn't want to simply create a Unity game - we wanted to create a
              new Unity, and build our game on that. The game that came out of
              this plan was EECSurvival, and the engine it was built on - The DFQE.<br><br>

              EECSurvival is a bullet hell style game that
              follows a lowly EECS student within the
              University of Kansas. Battle through the
              thought-provoking and adrenaline pumping
              story as the student overcomes heart break,
              immense pain, and the risk of a failed life
              path, to finally end as a self-fulfilled,
              successful student- no, a true programmer.<br><br>

              EECS was an experimental game created to test the capabilities of The
              Dairy Farmer Queen Engine. The game was created for a KU EECS
              (University of Kansas Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) class,
              so we figured it would be fitting for the player to be a student,
              battling their way up to EECS 448 - the Software Engineering class
              the project was made for. All of the enemies you encounter in the
              game are EECS professors, and were all placed in the game with explicit
              permission. The game is a standard bullet hell shooter, where you attempt
              to dodge incoming projectiles while at the same time firing projectiles
              at your enemy. Once the boss is defeated, you move on to the next stage.
              The engine allowed us to create special abilities for all of the bosses,
              so no one boss fight is like another. The game was a great success, and
              although there are a few bugs here and there, the project our team managed
              to create is very impressive for the amount of time we were given.<br><br>

              The Dairy Farmer Queen Engine (or "DFQE") is a 2D game engine built
              for the creation of 2D games. The engine was used for this bullet hell
              game, but it can support many other genres with minor tweaking. In fact,
              the original plan was to use the engine to make a JRPG like Pok√©mon,
              but we settled on the idea of a bullet hell because it would be simpler
              and was a more realistic goal for the amount of time we were given.
              The engine was created using the LWJGL (<a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/" target="_blank">
              Lightweight Java Game Library</a>), which we used to handle sprites and
              sound. LWJGL communicates directly with OpenGL, so we got a litte bit
              of practice using that service. Building this engine from the ground
              up really gave us a peek behind the curtain as to how games are actually
              made in conjunction with an engine.<br><br>

              The engine and game were created by a group of 5 students, going by many
              names including <i>The Dairy Farmers Who Want Donuts</i> and <i>The
              Queens of Fallingdownstairsland</i> (This is where the name "DFQE"
              comes from). Varun Chadha and I worked primarily on the development
              of the engine, while Alex Kunz, Harry Luo, and Noah Brabec worked
              on the creation of the game. In terms of the design of the game, we
              all pitched in, making the final product an idea we all enjoyed.<br><br>

            <h2>The Devlopment / Testing</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of the project was to work on a project using a agile-based
              development cycle. We created many documents in conjunction with the
              development process, including meeting logs, product backlogs, charts,
              and UML diagrams (a snippet of the class diagram can be seen bottom-left),
              all of which can be found in the
              <a href="https://github.com/justinro-underscore/EECSurvival-Game/tree/master/Documentation" target="_blank">
              Documentation folder of the github repo</a>. In addition to this, we
              also had to do testing. This was accomplished in three different ways:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A testing suite that checked the base functionality of the engine
                  itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An interactive testing room where you could try out the different
                  features of the game and assure they are working properly. (Bottom-right)
                </li>
                <li>
                  A noninteractive testing room that ran inputs randomly. The idea
                  for this was to just let it run and if something went wrong, an
                  error report would be generated.
                </li>
              </ol>
              These three testing options are all available from the main screen
              of the game, and they allowed for almost complete testing of the game
              and its engine.
