              <br>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787475/" target="_blank"><i>Hot Rod</i> (2007)</a>,
              directed by Akiva Schaffer and starring Andy Samberg, is technically
              a bad movie. Although the humor is childish and the entire film relies
              a bit too heavily on slapstick comedy, <b>it is one of me and my roommate's
              favorite films of all time</b>. We reference it constantly, and enjoy
              subjecting our friends to repeated viewings with commentary (which
              simply consists of him and I saying the lines with the actors). The
              movie is a pivotal part of our friendship, so when Tim's (my roommate's) birthday
              came around I had a great idea. I would go through the movie, make
              gifs of a few of our favorite parts, then load them all up onto a flash
              drive and give it to him. It would be <i>easy-peasy</i>...<br>

            <h2>The Gifs</h2>
            <p>
              The first thing I needed were gifs. I was supposed to find only 10
              to 15 or so gifs to collect, but I soon realized that there were way
              too many good moments to choose. What started as a 30-45 minute venture -
              take the clips, shorten them, and then make them into gifs - soon
              turned into a 15 hour sludge, as I made over 200 different gifs.

            <h2>The Site</h2>
            <p>
              Once I had all of the gifs, I needed a place to put them. I quickly
              realized that a flash drive wasn't gunna cut it - if you wanted to
              actually use these gifs, they would have to be available on messaging
              devices. This is where the idea for a website came in. The site was
              simple, mostly governed by a javascript function that made adding /
              changing gifs very easy. I quickly figured out that a search bar was
              necessary in order to find a specific gif. This was actually a very
              simple thing to add in given the preexisting website structure. Once
              all of the gifs were loaded in, I made them show up in pages, so as
              to get rid of the awful strain it would put on the computer to run all
              215 gifs simultaneously. However, as I soon learned, this would not
              be enough...

            <h2>The Issues</h2>
            <p>
              I ran into many issues when I tried to put all of the gifs on the website,
              and because of this, I went through many different iterations of the
              site. The first thing I tried was starting with a blank site with no
              gifs, and then have javascript add in all of the gifs when the site
              loaded up.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</b> This makes adding new gifs easy as pie.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</b> The computer has a tough time loading in over 200 gifs
              at once.<br>
              I had to think of a different plan. Instead of having javascript load
              in all of the gifs at load time, why don't I just hardcode everything?<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</b> Uh... I'll be honest this was a really bad idea.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</b> This didn't really help with the loading time like I thought
              it would...<br>
              I had to change my approach. The major problem I was having was
              that loading tons of gifs all at once made loading a pain. This gave
              me an idea: why don't I load them in one at a time? I would have the
              gif only load in when the user clicked on the gif's block.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</b> This <i>drastically</i> cut down on load time.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</b> It was kind of difficult to understand what gif you needed,
              now that the gif was not showing until you clicked on it.<br>
              It was close, but still not the perfect solution. Thankfully, the best
              solution simply required one more step: put thumbnails on all the gifs.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</b> The load time is minimal and the user can have a good
              idea of what gif they are looking at before they activate the gif.<br>
              <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</b> I now I have to go through and make thumbnails for <b>
              ALL 215 GIFS. I THOUGHT I WAS DONE WITH THIS PROJECT.</b><br><br>
